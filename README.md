# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Bengali-Text-Using-Deep-Learning
Sentiment Analysis for Bengali Text Using Deep Learning
Overview
This repository contains work on a cutting-edge research project aimed at harnessing deep learning for sentiment analysis in the Bengali language. Due to the rich linguistic nuances of Bengali, traditional sentiment analysis methods often fall short. Our approach leverages advanced models, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), renowned for their contextual understanding of language.

Objective
The project's primary goal is to develop a robust sentiment analysis system capable of comprehending the emotional undertones of text written in Bengali. By doing so, we hope to provide valuable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers interested in the Bengali-speaking demographic.

Repository Contents
Code-BERT.ipynb: Initial experiments with the BERT model for sentiment analysis.
Code-BERT-2epoch.ipynb and Code-BERT-3epoch.ipynb: Further training of the BERT model with increased epochs for enhanced performance.
Code-GPT2.ipynb: Implementation of sentiment analysis using the GPT-2 model.
Code-GPT2-2epochs.ipynb and Code-GPT2-3epochs.ipynb: Extended training sessions for the GPT-2 model, adjusting the number of epochs to optimize results.
Each notebook contains detailed code, comments, and observations regarding the experiments conducted and the outcomes obtained.

Methodology
Our approach is methodical and multifaceted:

Data Preparation: Utilizing diverse datasets from reliable sources, ensuring they represent various sentiment aspects in the Bengali language.
Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and structuring the data to make it suitable for training deep learning models.
Model Training: Experimenting with BERT and GPT-2 models, training them on the prepared data, and adjusting parameters, including the number of epochs, to gauge different performance impacts.
Evaluation: Assessing the models based on standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine their effectiveness in understanding the sentiment of Bengali text.
Results
The results of our experiments indicate significant potential in using deep learning for sentiment analysis in languages with complex linguistic structures like Bengali. Detailed results and discussions are available within each Jupyter notebook.
